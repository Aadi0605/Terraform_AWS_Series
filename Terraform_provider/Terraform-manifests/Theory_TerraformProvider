#About Terraform Provider

#providers are the heart of terraform 

#What Providers Do
  Each provider adds a set of resource types and/or data sources that Terraform can manage.
  Every resource type is implemented by a provider; without providers, Terraform can't manage any kind of infrastructure.
  
#Where Providers Come From
  The Terraform Registry is the main directory of publicly available Terraform providers, and hosts providers for most major infrastructure platforms.

#How to Use Providers
  Provider Requirements documents how to declare providers so Terraform can install them.

  Dependency Lock File documents an additional HCL file that can be included with a configuration, which tells Terraform to always use a specific set of provider versions.
