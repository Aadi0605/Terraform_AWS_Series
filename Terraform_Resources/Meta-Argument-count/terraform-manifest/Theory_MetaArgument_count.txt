Theory :

--> count is a meta-argument defined by the Terraform language. 
    It can be used with modules and with every resource type.

--> The count meta-argument accepts a whole number, and creates
    that many instances of the resource or module.
		Each instance has a distinct infrastructure object associated with it, 
and each is separately created, updated, or destroyed when the configuration is applied.

The count Object

In blocks where count is set, an additional count object is available in expressions, 
so you can modify the configuration of each instance. This object has one attribute:

--> count.index â€” The distinct index number (starting with 0) corresponding to this 
    instance.

example
resource "aws_instance" "server" {
  count = 4 # create four similar EC2 instances

  ami           = "ami-a1b2c3d4"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  tags = {
    Name = "Server ${count.index}"
  }
}
