Theory on Meta Argument "For each"

--> If a resource or module block includes a for_each argumentwhos value is map or set of strings,
	Terraform will create one instance for each member of that mapp or set .
	
--> Each instance has a distinct infrastructure object associated with it , and each is seperately 
		created , updated or destroyed when the configuration is applied .
		
--> In blocks where for_each is set , an additional each object is available in expressions , so we
	need to modify the configuration of each instances .

	each.key 	- The map key (or set member) corresponding to his instance .
	each.value  - The map value corresponding to this instance (if a set was provided, this is the same 
				  as each.key .
				
--> For set of strings, each.key = each.value
	for_each 	= toset("jack","james")
	each.key 	= jack
	each .value = james
	
--> For_each , we use each.key & each.value 
	for_each - {
			dev = "my-dapp-bucket"
			}
	each.key   = dev
	each.value = my-dapp-bucket
	
--> Module support for_each was added in Terraform 0.13 and previous versions can only use it with resources .

-->A given resources or module block cannot use both count and for_each .
