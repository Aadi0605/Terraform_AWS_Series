	Understand and define multiple provider configurations of same provider

#####The Resource provider Meta-Argument#####
The provider meta-argument specifies which provider configuration to use for a resource, overriding Terraform's default behavior of selecting one 
based on the resource type name. Its value should be an unquoted <PROVIDER>.<ALIAS> reference.

you can optionally create multiple configurations for a single provider (usually to manage resources in different regions of multi-region services).
 Each provider can have one default configuration, and any number of alternate configurations that include an extra name segment (or "alias").

Example:
# default configuration
provider "google" {
  region = "us-central1"
}

# alternate configuration, whose alias is "europe"
provider "google" {
  alias  = "europe"
  region = "europe-west1"
}
