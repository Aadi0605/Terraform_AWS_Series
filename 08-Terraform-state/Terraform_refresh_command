 Terraform refresh command
 
 --> This commands comes under Terraform Inspecting State . 
 
 --> The terraform refresh command is used to reconcile the state Terraform knows about (via its state file) with the real-world 
	 infrastructure. This can be used to detect any drift from the last-known state, and to update the state file.This does not 
	 modify infrastructure but does modify the state file.
	 
--> terraform refresh: Update local state file against real resources in cloud

-->Execute terraform refresh
You should see terraform state file updated with new demo tag
# Execute terraform refresh
terraform refresh

# Review terraform state file
1) terraform show
2) Also verify S3 bucket, new version of terraform.tfstate file will be created

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why you need to the execution in this order (refresh, plan, make a decision, apply) ?

--> There are changes happened in your infra manually and not via terraform.

--> Now decision to be made if you want those changes or not.

--> Choice-1: If you dont want those changes proceed with terraform apply so manual changes we have done on our cloud EC2 Instance 
	will be removed.
	
--> Choice-2: If you want those changes, refer terraform.tfstate file about changes and embed them in your terraform manifests 
	(example: c4-ec2-instance.tf) and proceed with flow (referesh, plan, review execution plan and apply)
