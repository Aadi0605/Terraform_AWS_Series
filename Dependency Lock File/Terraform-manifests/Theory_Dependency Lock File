Dependency Lock File 

New Feature added from 0.14 version and later -->

Terraform configuration refers to two different kinds of external dependency that come from outside of its own codebase .

Terraform  ----> Providers
		|
		| ------> Modules
		
#Version Constraints within the configuration itself determine which verison of dependencies are potentially compatible .

#Dependency Lock File: After selecting a specfic version of each dependency using VERSION CONSTRAINTS Terraform remembers 
the decision it made in a dependency lock file so that it can (by default) make the same decision again in future .

Location of lock file : Current working directory 

#####Note :
			Lock file currently tracks only provider dependencies .For modules continue to use exact version constraints 
			to ensure that Terraform will always select the module version .    

Checksum verification - Terraform will also verify that each package it installs matches at least one of the checksums it previously recorded in the lock file .
If any , returing an err if none of the checksum match .
++Pls refer attach pic

If Terraform did not find a lock file --> it would download the latest version of the providers that fulfill the version constraints you defined in the 
required_providers block inside Terraform settings block .

If we have lock file , the lock file causes terraform to always install the same provider version , ensuring that runs across your team or remote sessions 
will be consistent
