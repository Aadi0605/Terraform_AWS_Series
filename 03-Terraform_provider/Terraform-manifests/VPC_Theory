A Virtual private cloud is a virtual network that closly resembles a traditional Networking that you operate in your own data centre , 
with the benefits of using the scalable Infrastructure of AWS

OR

VPC is a virtual network or data center inside AWS for one client .

--> It is logically isolated from other network in the aw cloud 
--> Max 5 VPC can be created and 200subnets in 1 VPC 
--> We can allocate Max 5 Elastic IP
	# An Elastic IP address is a reserved public IP address that you can assign to any EC2 instance in a particular region,
	until you choose to release it. 
--> A VPC is confined to an AWS region and does not extend between Regions .
--> Once we created VPC , DHCP ,NACP , 

--> VPC is region specfic  i.e they cant be in 2 region or in any availbility zone 
--> Subnet are av zone specfic .i.e they cant be any region .

--> Once the VPC is created , you cannot change its CIDR Block Range .
--> If you need a different CIDR size , create a new VPC .
--> The different subnet within a VPC cant be overlap .
--> You can expand your VPC CIDR by adding New / Extra IP address Ranges (Except Gov cloud and AWS china)
